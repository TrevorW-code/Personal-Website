## My First Script

The first time I ever interacted with the unix cli ever was when I got my tonsils removed.

I couldn't really speak (or so I thought), so when bedridden so the next few days, I googled how I could do text to speech. That's when I came across unix's `say` command.

It was really fun asking for icecream during this time using that command. As silly as it was, I wrote a little script so I could invoke say for a few common commands.

I didn't know then, but that would be an important moment for me

Here's a sentence with a footnote. [^1]

### Making Something Useful

I still have some things that I use on a very regular basis. One of these things was a shortcuts script that ran shazam, and immediately looked up the song in youtube music.

I'll share it here if you are interested.
