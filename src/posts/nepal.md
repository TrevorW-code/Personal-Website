For most of my life, I had never stepped foot outside of the US. Asia seemed like a lofty dream, something that I'd brag I would always do “someday”.

That was, until my boss surprised me.

> Hey, would you be willing to stay in Nepal for a month?

I understood why. For context, most of the team I work with lives there. And, it was crunch time. Having helped my boss get a second round of funding, it was now time to deliver. Deadlines were upon us.

> Yes! I'm there.

Days the before the trip, I got cold feet. There was a lot riding on this trip. Most of the work that I had done up until this point had been essentially separate from the rest of the team. Beyond that, Nepal was really, _really_ far away. I’d be leaving everything behind.

Three days later, I was boarding.

### In the Air

As I squeezed into my first seat, shoved in the back of the airplane (startup life), I was overcome with anticipation. It wasn't the first time, but now I was actually _staying_.

Six months ago, I had stayed for a week with the team. It was very exciting, but the 12 hour difference made it hard to absorb what was happening. I was back before it had even started.

But *this* time, I was there for an entire month! I replayed the goodbyes from my family and friends in my head, excited for what was to come.

After what seemed like forever, I finally landed. With 3 different connections, everything was a blur. My concept of time, sleep, sense of self; everything goes out the window. I was grateful for the opportunity, but listening to the same songs over and over again for 26 hours will make anyone go crazy. 

A zombie, I limped off the plane, unconscious and ravenous.

### KTM

Luckily, one of my coworkers was waiting for me. We slid into a taxi, and she guided me through a quick checklist:

1. Currency Exchance
2. Food
3. Apartment Check-in

I was thankful to have someone helping me. 

After all three tasks, I collapsed on my bed. Finally, I could rest easy, and close my eyes.

### Cockroaches
