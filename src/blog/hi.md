### Who is Trevor?

Welcome to my first post! To be honest, I'm not really sure where to start with this kind of thing. I've been wanting to do this forever but just now decided to actually get a static site up and running. Let's see if I have anything cool to say.

#### Some Background

Out of all of my friends, I was the worst at pvp in minecraft. My friends and I would jump on a server, spend a few days gathering materials, and then start slashing each other to pieces. This was a really fun and incredibly frustrating time for me; I couldn't seem to get better at all. It was almost out of neccesity that I discovered **redstone**, and arguably, started programming.

Yes, making a 4x4 redstone door is **NOT** a monad, but let me cook here.

I'm honestly convinced my developer journey started with minecraft. I remember learning about all of the ways redstone could enhance my base (in usually meaningless ways, something even devs experience), and becoming fascinated with these silly contraptions.

As a kid, I was always interested in **building**. It didn't matter if it was pillow forts or legos; building things has always seemed to be a small passion for me. I think this is the experience of most people developing nowadays. While on a lan server, your friends are out killing minecraft zombies and getting ore, and you're the one inside the base, making little redstone contraptions.

I still try to approach some of the problems I see today with that same wide-eyed enthusiasm I had as a teen. Some of the things I build were really stupid, and some I look back at and still can't manage to figure out how I did it. I hope you take your curiousity with you too.
