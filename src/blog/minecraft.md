### Who is Trevor?

Welcome to my first post! To be honest, I'm not really sure where to start with this kind of thing. I've been wanting to do this forever but just now decided to actually get a static site up and running. Let's see if I have anything cool to say.

#### Some Background

Out of all of my friends, I was the worst at pvp in minecraft. 

My friends and I would jump on a server, spend a few days gathering materials, and then start slashing each other to pieces. This was a really fun, but also incredibly frustrating time for me. I would constantly loose, and I couldn't seem to get better at all. It was almost out of neccesity that I discovered **redstone**, and arguably, started programming.

That's what this blog is about. Honestly, I'm convinced my developer journey started with minecraft. I remember learning about all of the ways I could use redstone, and becoming totally fascinated with these silly contraptions.

As a kid, I was always interested in **building**. It didn't matter if it was pillow forts or legos; building things has always seemed to be a small passion for me. 

I still try to approach some of the problems I see today with that same wide-eyed enthusiasm I had as a teen. Some of the things I build were really stupid, and some I look back at and still can't manage to figure out how I did it. I hope you take your curiousity with you too.
